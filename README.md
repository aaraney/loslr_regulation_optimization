# Optimization and Simulation of Lake Ontario Flow Regulation

There are two major components to the workflow in this repository: the **[simulation and optimization](#simulation-optimization)** of alternative outflow control policies and the **[visualization and data analysis](#data-visualization-and-post-analysis)** on optimized alternatives. This repository contains code to:

1. Optimize control policies
1. Simulate plan prescribed outflows and water levels
1. Assess policy performance for key system objectives
1. Explore results in an interactive dashboard

<!-- For forecast generation, see [this](https://github.com/ksemmendinger/Plan-2014-Python) repository. -->

*Disclaimer: While the Bv7 rule curve and flow limit functions have been verified using the [Great Lakes Regulation and Routing Model](https://github.com/cc-hydrosub/GLRRM-Ontario), this repository is **not** intended to simulate official Plan 2014 prescribed outflows and simulate the resulting water levels.*

<br>

## Simulation-Optimization

There are seven major components required to simulate and optimize alternative control policies, which are described in more detail below:

1. [Configuration File](#configuration-file)
1. [Optimization Algorithm](#optimization-algorithm)
1. [Input Data File](#input-data)
1. [Release Function](#release-function)
1. [Flow Limit Function](#flow-limits)
1. [Routing Function](#routing-scheme)
1. [Objective Functions](#objective-functions)

This repository makes a **key assumption** that a control policy is made up of two modules: a ***release function*** and ***flow limits*** (or operational adjustments). The release function calculates a preliminary flow, which is then checked against a series of flow limits and modified if the preliminary flow falls outside of those flow limits. Flow limits are a major component of flow regulation in the Plan 2014 control policy (e.g. I-limit, L-limit, F-limit). See Annex B, Section B2 in the [Plan 2014 Compendium Report](resources/Plan2014_CompendiumReport.pdf) for more details. The Bv7 ruleset is included in this repository; however, this repository does not contain code to simulate Board deviations decisions under the [H14 criteria](https://www.ijc.org/en/loslrb/watershed/faq/4#:~:text=Criterion%20H14%20allows%20for%20major,water%20supplies%20to%20Lake%20Ontario.).

### Configuration File
The optimization requires several hyperparameters, decision variables, and simulation modules. These fields are specified in a user-generated configuration file. Configuration files are written using the [toml](https://toml.io/en/) file format. A template and examples of a configuration file can be found [here](config/). The variables that must be specified in a configuration file are described below.

<summary><h3>Objective Functions</h3></summary>

Objective functions are simulated over the user-specified time period. Each objective is aggregated by the net annual average value, and that metric is returned to Borg to drive the optimization. More information on the objective function formulations and required inputs can be found [here](objectiveFunctions/).

### Candidate Policy Selection
Select from dashboard...

### Policy Simulation

Borg returns the decision variables values of policy that fall on the Pareto Frontier. However, the time series of water levels and objective performance is not returned. To run the simulation model and return the time series of hydrologic attributes and performance indicators, run the `policySimulation.py` script.

### Secondary Analyses

This repository contains code to calculate...

Users can add additional analysis scripts to the output/ folder and call them in the postAnalysis.sh script to run.

# Getting Started

## Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm

Before any runs, you will need to download and compile the many-objective evolutionary algorithm, [Borg](https://doi.org/10.1162/EVCO_a_00075). A two-part tutorial on setup (with an example) is available [here](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2015/06/25/basic-borg-moea-use-for-the-truly-newbies-part-12/) by the Reed Lab at Cornell University. Once you have compiled Borg, you can introduce new simulation and evaluation problems.

You'll need to move the `borg.c`, `borg.py`, and `libborg.so` to the directory with your wrapper script.

<br>

## Demo
In this example, the `plan2014_wrapper.py` script talks to Borg. In the wrapper script, you can specify the number of decision variables and their ranges, the number of objectives, the epsilon of significance for each objective value, and other parameters of the Borg MOEA.

The wrapper script points to an external simulation-evaluation function, in this case `plan2014_optim.py`. The simulation function takes in an array of decision variables, simulates the time series of water levels and flows over a given supply sequence, calculates objective performance over the time series, and returns an array of length n, where n is the number of objectives, to Borg.


#### Run Optimization
You can run Borg on your local machine from the command line or on a HPC (see example SLURM script, [`runOptimization.sh`](./runOptimization.sh)):

```
python plan2014_wrapper.py {FN} {TRACE} {LEADTIME} {SKILL} {N_SEEDS} {NFE} {POPSIZE} {REPORT} {DVBOUNDS} {NDVS}
```

You will need to specify the:

- `FN`: Directory
- `TRACE`: Hydrologic trace to simulate for optimization
- `LEADTIME`: Forecast lead-time (for Plan 2014 input `12month`)
- `SKILL`: Forecast skill level (for Plan 2014 input `sqAR`)
- `N_SEEDS`: Number of seeds to run in parallel
- `NFE`: Number of function evaluations (1 NFE = 1 trace simulation)
- `POPSIZE`: Initial population size (100 is a good default)
- `REPORT`: Frequency to report pareto front evolution 
- `DVBOUNDS`: Percent change to decision variables for upper and lower limits
- `NDVS`: Number of decision variables

#### *A Posteriori* Evaluation
After running the optimization, to assess the pareto front for the *a posteriori* criteria, run the following command:

```
python output/evaluate.sh {FN} {N_SEEDS} {LEADTIME} {SKILL} {NFE} {NOBJS} {NDVS} {NWORKERS}
```
Where the `FN`, `N_SEEDS`, `LEADTIME`, `SKILL`, `NFE`, and `NDVS` corresponds to the values used to run the optimization, and:

- `NOBJS`: Number of objectives in the optimization
- `NWORKERS`: Number of workers to run in parallel for resimulation


#### Dashboard
Results from the optimization and simulation of candidate plans for objective functions and *a posteriori* performance indicators are displayed in an interactive dashboard (based in an R Shiny app). First, compile the results by running the following command:

```
python output/dashboard/dataRetrieval.py
```

You can then run the dashboard by navigating to the `dashboard/` directory, activating the conda environment, and launching r:

```
cd output/dashboard/
r
shiny::runApp()
```

More detail on running the dashboard is available [here](output/dashboard/README.md).
