### AR-Based Forecast Information

The current control policy, [Plan 2014](resources/Plan_2014_Report.pdf), takes in the current water level of Lake Ontario, $Level_{Ont}$, and a forecasted supply index, $NTS_{fcst}$, and prescribes releases based on a sliding rule curve function and adjusts the rule curve release via embedded flow constraints. 

The forecasted supply index, $NTS_{fcst}$, at any given quarter-month, $q$, is calculated by inputing the rolling average annual net total supply calculated into an autoregressive time series model:

$$ NTS_{prev} = \overline {NTS_{q - 49} : NTS_{q - 1}} $$

$$ NTS_{fcst} = AR_{1}(NTS_{prev}) $$


Input hydrologic files are provided for the historic supply data from 1900 - 2020 (`input/historic/hydro`).
